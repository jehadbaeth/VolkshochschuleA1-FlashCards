# Netzwerk neu A1 FlashCards

## Content: 
This GitHub repository contains a collection of flashcards created from words collected from the course book [Netzwerk neu A1 Glossary](https://www.thelanguageoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NWn_A1_Glossar_Deutsch-Englisch.pdf). The words have been manually processed and converted so they're easily importable by Anki, an open-source spaced repetition software. Nouns include its designated article and the plural form suffex for easier memorization. 

Currently the deck cotains the first three chapter of the book. I'll try to add more sections as we progress in the course. You can either study one chapter at a time or study all of them at once.

Here are detailed instructions on how to install Anki and import this package onto your device:

## Installing Anki:
1. Visit the official [Anki website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Iphone, Android, Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Install the software by following the on-screen instructions provided during installation.
3. Once installed, launch Anki from your desktop or start menu.
4. If prompted to create a new deck, select "Skip this step" and proceed with setting up your account (if required) or directly open an existing deck if you already have one.
5. Your Anki installation is now complete! You can close the application for now as we move on to importing our flashcard package.

## Importing the Flashcards Package:
1. Download the latest version of this Flash card collection by simply downloading the [.colpkg](https://github.com/jehadbaeth/VolkshochschuleA1-FlashCards/raw/main/German%20A1.1%20Flash%20Cards.colpkg) file from this repo.
2. Open Anki and click on "File > Import > From File..." in the menu bar.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder containing the flashcards package, select it, and click "Open".
4. In the import settings window that appears, ensure that "Add cards to an existing deck" is selected. If you have a specific Anki deck where you want these flashcards added, choose it from the dropdown menu; otherwise, create a new one by clicking on "+ Create Deck..." and filling in the required details.
5. Click "Continue". The import process will begin, adding all the words collected from the course book (PDF Name) as Anki cards to your selected deck.
6. Once completed, you can start reviewing these flashcards using Anki's built-in scheduling algorithm for effective learning and retention of information!

The repo contains the .csv with all the raw materials extracted from the PDF glossary.
